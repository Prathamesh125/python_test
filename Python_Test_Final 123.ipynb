    "    \n",
    "      – Explanation: The input word remains untouched (e.g., input: houses, output: houses).\n",

    "    \n",
    "      – Explanation: The input word is a proper noun, and therefore cannot be pluralized (e.g., input: Adam, output: Adam).\n",
    "\n",
    "    • How to determine plural form: We will assume a word is in plural if it ends with ’s’.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • How to determine if a word is a proper noun: We will assume a word is a proper noun if it exists in the file proper nouns.txt.

The values in your output dictionary, however, will retain the original capitalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If the word is not plural and is not a proper noun, then:\n",
    "  Apply the following English plural rules.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • If the word ends with a vowel:\n",

    "        \n",

    "### Question 4 - Function renamer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are working on a large-scale software project involving thousands of different Python files. The files have been written by different programmers and the naming of functions is somewhat inconsistent. You receive a new directive stating that the function names all have to be in camel case. In camel case, function names consisting of multiple words have a capital letter in each word and most underscores are removed. For instance, `def MyArithmeticCalculator()` is in camel case but `def my_arithmetic_calculator()` is not in camel case.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to write a Python program that automatically processes Python code and renames the function names instead of doing it by hand. The instruction states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.) All functions names need to be changed to camel case. E.g. a function\n",
    "  `calculate_speed_of_vehicle()` needs to be renamed to `CalculateSpeedOfVehicle()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2.) If the function has one or more leading ’_’ (underscores) they need to be preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "  All other underscores need to be removed. E.g. a function `__calc_size()` is renamed to `__CalcSize()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3.) If the function is already in camel case, you do not need to change it but it still needs to appear in the dictionary d specified below.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4.) You can assume that there will be no name clashes. That is, a given function name which is not in camel case will not already appear in camel case elsewhere. E.g.if there is a function `print_all_strings()` then there is no function `PrintAllStrings()` elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) Tip: You can use regular expressions to find the function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, write a function `function_renamer(code)` that takes as input a string code that represents the Python code. It is typically a multi-line Python string. Your function needs to return the tuple `(d, newcode)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  • `d` is a nested dictionary where each key corresponds to the original function name. The value is a nested dictionary that has the following items:\n",
    "\n",
    "    – hash: hash code of the original function name (tip: use Python’s hash function)\n",
    "\n",
    "    – camelcase: camel case version of original function name\n",
    "\n",
    "    – allcaps: all caps version of original function name\n",
    "\n",
    "  • newcode is a string containing the code wherein all function names have been renamed by their camel case versions. Note that you need to change the function name and also all other locations where the function name is used (e.g. function calls). You should not change anything else in the code (e.g. the contents of any strings). To clarify this, a few examples are given below:\n",
